# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Fix ModuleNotFoundError

## 🔧 Solution 1: Install Missing Package

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory and virtual environment
cd /Users/aansh/Documents/introspective-diary/FiananceAnalysisCrew
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the missing package
pip install crewai-tools

# OR run the complete installer
chmod +x install_missing.sh
./install_missing.sh
```

## 🎯 Solution 2: Use Version Without External Tools

We've created versions that work WITHOUT crewai_tools:

```bash
# Option A: CrewAI without web tools
python crew_no_tools.py

# Option B: Direct OpenAI (no CrewAI needed)
python direct_openai_analysis.py

# Option C: Test if CrewAI is working
python test_crewai.py
```

## 📊 What Each Script Does:

1. **crew_no_tools.py** - Full CrewAI multi-agent system without web search tools
2. **direct_openai_analysis.py** - Simulates agents using OpenAI directly (always works!)
3. **test_crewai.py** - Quick test to verify your setup
4. **install_missing.sh** - Installs all missing packages

## 🐍 Python 3.13 Compatibility Note:

Some packages might not fully support Python 3.13 yet. If you continue having issues:

```bash
# Check available Python versions
ls -la /opt/homebrew/bin/python* | grep -E "python3\.[0-9]+"

# If you have Python 3.11:
python3.11 -m venv venv311
source venv311/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ✅ Recommended Order:

1. First try: `python test_crewai.py` (checks your setup)
2. Then try: `python direct_openai_analysis.py` (always works)
3. Finally: `python crew_no_tools.py` (full CrewAI experience)

The scripts work without web search tools, using the AI's trained knowledge instead!
