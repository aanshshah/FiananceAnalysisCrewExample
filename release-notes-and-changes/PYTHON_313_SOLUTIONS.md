# üö® Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues - Solutions

You're experiencing compatibility issues because **Python 3.13 is too new** for many CrewAI dependencies.

## üéØ Immediate Solution (Works Now!)

Run this command - it works with ANY Python version:

```bash
python direct_openai_analysis.py
```

This gives you a working financial analysis chatbot that simulates multi-agent collaboration without needing CrewAI!

## üîß Option 1: Install Compatible Packages for Python 3.13

```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Make the installer executable
chmod +x install_python313.sh

# Run the installer
./install_python313.sh

# Then test with
python minimal_working_example.py
```

## üêç Option 2: Use Python 3.11 (Recommended for Full CrewAI)

Check what Python versions you have:
```bash
chmod +x check_python_options.sh
./check_python_options.sh
```

If you have Python 3.11:
```bash
# Create new virtual environment with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv311
source venv311/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python example_usage.py
```

If you don't have Python 3.11:
```bash
# Install it with Homebrew
brew install python@3.11
```

## üìä Option 3: Use the Streamlit Demo

For a quick demo without the full CrewAI features:
```bash
streamlit run app_simple.py
```

## üé≠ What Each File Does:

1. **direct_openai_analysis.py** - Works immediately! No CrewAI needed
2. **minimal_working_example.py** - Simplest CrewAI example for Python 3.13
3. **install_python313.sh** - Installs latest compatible versions
4. **check_python_options.sh** - Shows your Python version options
5. **app_simple.py** - Streamlit demo interface

## ‚ùì Why This Happens:

- CrewAI 0.30.11 doesn't exist (versions jump from 0.11.2 to 0.126.0)
- Many packages haven't been updated for Python 3.13 yet
- The ecosystem needs time to catch up with new Python releases

## ‚úÖ Recommended Path:

1. **Right now**: Run `python direct_openai_analysis.py` to see it working
2. **For full CrewAI**: Install Python 3.11 and use that
3. **For quick demos**: Use the Streamlit interface

The direct OpenAI version shows you exactly what the multi-agent system does - it's actually a great way to understand the concept!
